# Hub: state of Louis's Underworld work across machines

The cloud hub session keeps this file current. It is the single point of truth for which
machine does what, what is running, what is open, and what waits on Louis. Read it before
acting. Newest entries in the log at the bottom win over anything above them that they
contradict.

## Restarting the hub

The hub is a Claude Code cloud session on `underworldcode/underworld3`. It holds no state that
is not in this file, on GitHub, or in session transcripts. If it dies:

1. Start a new cloud session on `underworldcode/underworld3` with this prompt:
   > You are the hub that coordinates Louis Moresi's Underworld work across his machines.
   > Read `HUB.md` in lmoresi/uw3-campaigns (main) and follow it. The previous hub was
   > `<session id below>`; read its transcript (claude-code-remote `list_events`) only for
   > detail this file lacks. Then confirm the state to Louis in a few lines.
2. Approve the "reach my other sessions" card when the new hub first messages a machine. The
   grant is per session.
3. The new hub tells each machine session its session id, and updates this file.
4. Re-arm any check-ins (scheduled tasks are bound to the session that made them).

| | Session id |
|---|---|
| hub (current) | `session_013CgVT1Gx9WTvaZVqU58HsQ` |
| hyperion | `session_01QZvR7SZKsjcFnzx2aLxn1j` ("hyperion-zesty-dijkstra") |
| kaiju | `session_01HX67HY6xwuJivHKLLXrR3H` ("kaiju-anu-edu-au-jiggly-magpie") |
| laptop (wombat), lid regime | `session_019aromUkeWWPzcL2Kb8365E` ("Lid regime box heating runs") |

Messaging: the hub can message all three. Kaiju and the laptop can message the hub. Hyperion
cannot (its Claude Code is too old to prove a trusted device), so the hub reads its transcript.

## Machines and roles

**hyperion**: one big box with a failing system disk (nvme0 throws EIO). Use it for
**fast-turnaround parallel development jobs** (tests, probes, np 2-16, minutes, not days).
No long campaigns.
- Everything lives on the second drive under `/mnt/data/lmoresi/`: the `underworld3` clone,
  `Simulations` (symlinked from `~/+Simulations` once Louis approves), the caches, and
  `claude-mirror`. Nothing of value goes on nvme0.
- Pixi env `dev` (conda-forge PETSc 3.25). It needs `PIXI_CACHE_DIR`, `RATTLER_CACHE_DIR`,
  `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, `UW_JIT_CACHE_DIR` and `TMPDIR` pointed at `/mnt/data/lmoresi/...`, plus
  `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1`.
- The rescue copy of the old disk is in `/mnt/data/lmoresi/hyperion-rescue-2026-10-20/`. It is
  frozen; do not modify it.

**kaiju**: a Slurm cluster. Use it for **long runs and campaigns**.
- Usable nodes are n5-n8 (n1-n4 down since 2026-09-23, including bigmem n3); use
  `--exclude='n[1-4]'`. Each node has 52 cores (Slurm counts 104 CPUs) and 140-188 GB.
- Underworld3 runs in Apptainer. Use the personal image `~/uw3/images/uw3-gadi-development-20261021.sif`
  (the shared site images are stale and have no g++), and run a branch as an overlay built
  inside it. See [uw3-hpc-install-run kaiju/container](https://github.com/underworld-community/uw3-hpc-install-run/tree/main/kaiju/container)
  (PR #1).
- Overlays: `~/uw3/overlay-bn` (bugfix/backward-nodes-snapshot-order) and
  `~/uw3/overlay-box-faults` (feature/box-faults c1107957).
- Submit from home (`/tmp` is node-local). All I/O goes through the login node's NFS. There is
  no scratch filesystem.
- **There are no GitHub credentials on kaiju.** Fixes come to the hub as `git format-patch`
  output, and the hub pushes them.

**wombat (laptop)**: runs the live lid-regime run on 8 cores at most. Commits to uw3-campaigns
only when Louis asks.

## Standing rules (Louis)

- Never `pip install -e`. Work on side branches, never development or main of underworld3.
  Push after every commit. Run `git show --stat HEAD` before every push.
- Every bug fix ships the regression test, shown failing first. Run an adversarial review before
  every PR. Open PRs only when Louis asks.
- Fix rather than flag. Solver tuning only with benchmarks. No direct LU. A silent GAMG fallback
  is a misconfiguration. Everything parallel-safe.
- Never rebalance the base mesh. One nested ladder hierarchy for split and TI faults.
- No default changes until Louis has seen evidence. The JOSS paper is frozen.
- Commit messages end with "Underworld development team with AI support from Claude Code" and
  carry no Co-Authored-By line.
- Show figures through GitHub links. Write useful machine knowledge back to
  underworld-community/uw3-hpc-install-run. If a container must be built, use conda PETSc.

## Open work

| What | Where | State |
|---|---|---|
| Stress-transport fix | underworld3 `bugfix/backward-nodes-snapshot-order` | d77bc9d2 (recreated after the disk failure, identical to 6549d30b); verified on hyperion and kaiju. Follow-ups running on hyperion: Eulerian/SUPG ordering, docs, renumber test_1076, review. No PR yet. |
| VE/plastic gap closure | PRs #851 #852 #853 #854 | open |
| subksp banner #827 | PR #850 | open |
| Parallel add-on distribution | `feature/parallel-addon-distribution` 8fe9ad76 | pushed, no PR |
| Shear-band length scale | `feature/shear-band-length-scale` 114c472c | second adversarial review owed |
| Tidal shell / box-fault study | `feature/tidal-shell` fc35972a | waiting on Louis: gravitational topography term, next sweep |
| Hyperion rescue WIP | underworld3 branches `*-hyperion-2026-10-20*`, uw3-campaigns `main-hyperion-2026-10-20-wip` | saved, untriaged |
| Lid-regime annulus campaign | uw3-campaigns `zg95-annulus-for-kaiju` e258447, needs underworld3 `feature/box-faults` c1107957 | being moved to kaiju (below) |
| Kaiju docs | underworld-community/uw3-hpc-install-run PR #1 | open |
| Parallel `read_checkpoint` bug | found on kaiju, 2026-10-21 | not filed or fixed yet; the lid-regime driver is not affected |

## Waiting on Louis

- Make uw3-campaigns public (agreed), so kaiju can clone it.
- rsync lid-regime checkpoints 3580 (and 3250) to kaiju `~/campaigns/zg95/checkpoints/`.
- Choose the first kaiju sweep (the laptop session recommends tau1/Ra 2.5-3 at Ra x3, from 3570/3580).
- Hyperion: approve the `~/.bashrc` env lines and phase 3 (Simulations symlink, hourly
  `~/.claude` mirror, local notes).
- Update Claude Code on hyperion and restart its session there (restores hyperion -> hub messages).
- Get the hyperion rescue's 449 MB `claude/` directory off the machine.
- Whether the parallel `read_checkpoint` bug goes to hyperion as the next fix.

## Log

- 2026-10-18: hyperion's system disk failed. The hub recreated the unpushed stress-transport
  fix (d77bc9d2) and pushed it; it was later verified identical to the original.
- 2026-10-19/20: recovered the hyperion sessions' work from transcripts. Everything committed
  was already on GitHub; the transcript-only material went to Louis.
- 2026-10-20: rescued hyperion's surviving files to /mnt/data (92.1 of 92.1 GB; 9 files
  unreadable). Fresh clone and build on /mnt/data; 1494 tier-A tests pass.
- 2026-10-21: the stress-transport fix was verified on hyperion (49 passed; test_1076 fails
  without the fix). Kaiju surveyed: the site images are stale; a personal image plus an overlay
  runs any branch (test_1076 3 passed at np 1 and 2), documented in uw3-hpc PR #1. Kaiju got its
  feature/box-faults overlay; the annulus smoke test passes at 8 ranks.
- 2026-10-22: roles set (hyperion for fast development, kaiju for campaigns). Hyperion started
  the stress-transport follow-ups. The lid-regime drivers were pushed (e258447). Kaiju's rules:
  no credentials, fixes go to the hub as patches. Louis agreed to make uw3-campaigns public.
  This file was created.
